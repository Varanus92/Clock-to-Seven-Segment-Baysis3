# Clock-on-Seven-Segment-Baysis3-FPGA

## Introduction:

Clock is on of the simple electronic things we know from chilidhood.
Its facinating to know the way this small things works.

-----------
## Goal:

Design a full functioining clock (seconds,minutes,hours) and implement it on
Seven Segment on Baysis3 FPGA and PmodSSD.

------------
## Solution (Only from above explaination):

Designing:
#"time base counter" to create pulse every 1 sec (from 100Mhz internal clock)
prepare 3 counters for seconds,minutes and hours.

#Seven Segment block (binary to Seven Segment decoding)

#logic ontroling the refresh rate of the Seven Segment Display of Baysis3 and PmodSSD*

#clock function (reset,load time value) using on board pin and buttons via XDC file.

#Bitstream file from VivadoÂ®

Loading the Bitstream to the Baysis3 Board and see the results!

*note: Taken into account the diffrance in connection of the anodes/cathods in Baysis3 and PmodSSD.
